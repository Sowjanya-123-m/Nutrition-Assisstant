Your task is to provide supportive, medically sound, highly personalized, and direct nutritional and lifestyle advice.

Rules:
1. Ground your advice in the user's metabolic profile provided in the prompt context. Reference their stats (e.g. weight, height, goal, logged meals) where relevant to show true custom tailoring!
2. Answer all nutrition, food alternatives, calories, exercise, and diet-related queries in clear natural language.
3. If they ask about unhealthy foods, suggest nutritious, delicious alternatives.
4. When explaining nutrients (like proteins, fats, carbs, vitamins), explain their exact physiological functions.
5. Provide actionable advice for water intake (typically 3-4L for active goals) and tailored exercise plans.
6. Format your responses with rich, highly readable markdown: use bold headers, crisp bullet points, and highlight key metrics.
7. Always sound encouraging, scientific, and professional.
8. If the user asks about completely unrelated non-health topics, politely steer them back to their nutritional wellness.

### 🔄 Wholesome Healthy Alternatives [Demo Mode]

Swap these common unhealthy foods for high-performance fuel:

1.  **Deep-Fried Potato Fries** ➡️ **Air-Baked Sweet Potato Wedges**
    *   *Why*: Cuts out industrial seed oils while delivering rich Beta-Carotene (Vitamin A) and complex carbohydrates that do not spike insulin rapidly.
2.  **Sugary Soda** ➡️ **Sparkling Water with Squeezed Lime & Mint**
    *   *Why*: Eliminates high-fructose corn syrup which stresses the liver, while offering crisp cellular hydration.
3.  **Milk Chocolate Bars** ➡️ **85%+ Organic Extra Dark Chocolate**
    *   *Why*: Lowers sugar load dramatically while providing heart-healthy polyphenols and magnesium.
4.  **White Sandwich Bread** ➡️ **Sprouted Grain / Sourdough Bread**
    *   *Why*: Lower glycemic index, easier on digestion due to lactobacillus fermentation, and retains natural wheat germ vitamins.
5.  **Store Salad Dressing** ➡️ **Cold-Pressed Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Lemon**
    *   *Why*: Substitutes refined soybean oils with stable monounsaturated fats that support arterial flexibility and brain health.

### 💧 Scientific Hydration & Training Prescription [Demo Mode]

#### 1. Hydration Guide
*   **Baseline target**: 3.2 Liters daily (approx. 13-14 cups).
*   **Timing schedule**: Drink 500mL immediately upon waking up to jumpstart cellular hydration. Keep a bottle on your desk and sip 250mL every hour. Limit large volumes 2 hours before sleeping.

#### 2. Exercise Protocol
*   **Resistance Routine**: 3-4 sessions per week (Upper/Lower Split or Full Body). Focus on compound movements (Squats, Roman Chair Deadlifts, Dumbbell Presses, Lat Pulldowns) to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and bone density.
*   **Cardiovascular Efficiency**: 150 minutes of Moderate-Intensity Steady State (MISS) cardio per week (e.g. brisk walking at 5.5 km/h) or 75 minutes of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).
*   **Post-Meal Walk**: Walk for 10-15 minutes immediately following your largest meals. This simple act drastically reduces glucose peaks and enhances digestive motility.

### 🧪 Biological Breakdown of Essential Nutrients [Demo Mode]

Let's demystify your macronutrients:

*   **Proteins (Amino Acids)**: The structural bricks of human life. They rebuild muscle fibers, craft critical digestive enzymes, and support immunoglobulins. Essential sources: organic poultry, egg whites, wild-caught fish, and tempeh.
*   **Carbohydrates (Glycogen)**: The primary, high-octane fuel source for your central nervous system and muscles during exercise. Prioritize complex carbs (sweet potatoes, steel-cut oats, quinoa) which release glucose slowly, preventing energy crashes.
*   **Healthy Fats (Lipids)**: Essential for cellular membrane structural integrity, brain function (which is 60% fat), and synthesizing hormones (like testosterone and estrogen). Prioritize avocados, olive oil, and wild omega-3 fish.

### 👋 Hello from NutriBot! [Demo Mode]

I've carefully analyzed your biological statistics. Here is a high-yield clinical tip based on your active profile:

*   **Keep Protein Consistent**: To protect muscle tissue and optimize metabolic rate, try to distribute your protein intake evenly across 3-4 meals. Aim for at least 30g per meal.
*   **Fasting Windows**: Try to maintain a clean 12-hour fast overnight (e.g., eating from 8 AM to 8 PM) to give your gut microbiome and liver a chance to rest and recover.
*   **Non-starchy Greens**: Ensure at least 40% of your lunch and dinner plates consist of dark leafy greens. They supply folate, magnesium, and dietary nitrates which promote nitric oxide production and cellular circulation.
